Note that I put my information inside p3.sh to run.

Fixed a typo that I had under the schema.txt under visit_flat.
Took out age attribute from Visitor, left just DOB.
Used data_with_faker.py for a several tables (Mostly inputed real information manually).

Note that the python script may return tuples that are duplicated by chance, in those cases I manually changed the primary key values.
I will fix that when we need to generate a very large dataset to ensure there are not duplicates.
